description: >
  Stands up isolated, realistic environments from a declarative profile so software
  can be tested as though actually deployed, and manages them for their whole life:
  author a profile, launch it, run commands inside, copy files in and out, update it,
  and tear it down. Use when "tests pass locally" is not enough evidence and you need
  to exercise code the way a real deployment would.
use_cases:
  - Turn a description of what you want to test into a launchable environment profile
  - Test a web app in a container that mirrors its real deployment
  - Verify a CLI tool installs and runs cleanly from scratch
  - Simulate an end-user environment without touching production
  - Exercise code against mocked third-party services without changing its configuration
  - Work out why a host cannot launch environments, and what to run to fix it
platforms:
  - linux
requires:
  - name: incus
    purpose: Runs the environments a profile describes. Without it, profiles can still be authored and validated, but nothing launches.
    optional: true
    install: docs/installing-incus.md
  - name: git
    purpose: Fetches the agent engine's modules. The model-backed capabilities cannot run without it.
    install: https://git-scm.com/downloads
  - name: docker
    purpose: Runs mock service sidecars beside an environment. Without it, profiles declaring sidecars cannot launch; everything else does.
    optional: true
    install: docs/installing-docker.md
  - name: avahi
    purpose: Publishes an environment as a .local hostname. Without it, environments are still reachable at localhost on their mapped ports.
    optional: true
    install: docs/installing-incus.md

A Digital Twin Universe (DTU) is a complete, isolated environment stood up on demand
from a declarative profile. It closes the gap between "the tests pass on my machine"
and "this works where it will actually run."

**The library is the tool.** `amplifier_digital_twin_universe` holds every capability.
The CLI is a thin wrapper over it, so anything you can do from the shell you can also
do from Python. Confirm every capability, argument, and field name against
`<capability> --help` or the library's own signatures before writing code. To chain
capabilities, such as launch, exec, and destroy in one flow, or to combine them with other
smart tools, write a script against the libraries and pass return values between calls
rather than piping CLI output.

## When to reach for it

- What you want to verify depends on its environment: a service that must resolve real
  hostnames, a CLI that must install from scratch, a web app whose behavior differs
  behind a proxy.
- You need a throwaway machine you can provision, exercise, and delete without touching
  anything you care about.
- A host will not launch environments and the error alone does not say why.

Not for pure logic you can test in-process. Standing up an environment costs seconds to
minutes; a function call costs microseconds.

## Install

```bash
# as a CLI
uv tool install git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-smart-tool-digital-twin-universe

# as a library
uv add "amplifier-digital-twin-universe @ git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-smart-tool-digital-twin-universe"
```

## Prerequisites

Ask the tool rather than assuming. `check` measures this host and reports what is
present, what is absent, and what each absence costs.

`incus` runs the environments; without it nothing launches. `docker` runs mock service
sidecars; without it everything works except profiles that declare sidecars. `git` is
required by the model-backed capabilities. `avahi` publishes `.local` hostnames. Linux
only. `knowledge/installing.md` covers installing each one.

## Model-backed capabilities

`create-profile`, `install`, `doctor`, and `manage` consume tokens, may answer
differently on a second run, and fail saying so when no provider is configured rather
than returning a lesser answer. Each reasons over measured evidence and takes minutes,
up to tens of minutes for a broad request; size the timeout for that and poll rather
than blocking on a short one. Every other capability is deterministic and runs with no
model provider configured.

## Worked invocations

```bash
# what this host can do right now, and what it is missing
amplifier-digital-twin-universe check

# ordered steps to make this host able to launch
amplifier-digital-twin-universe install --goal "test a web service"

# describe what you want to test; get a profile that parses
amplifier-digital-twin-universe create-profile \
  --description "a FastAPI app on port 8000 with a /health endpoint" --out profile.yaml

# stand it up, exercise it, take the results out, delete it
amplifier-digital-twin-universe launch --profile profile.yaml
amplifier-digital-twin-universe check-readiness --id dtu-1a2b3c4d
amplifier-digital-twin-universe exec --id dtu-1a2b3c4d --command "curl -sf localhost:8000/health"
amplifier-digital-twin-universe file-pull --id dtu-1a2b3c4d --source /var/log/app.log --destination ./
amplifier-digital-twin-universe destroy --id dtu-1a2b3c4d

# work out what is wrong, in your own words
amplifier-digital-twin-universe doctor --symptom "the container has no outbound network"

# plan several actions from one request, then run them
amplifier-digital-twin-universe manage --request "tear down every stopped environment"
amplifier-digital-twin-universe manage --request "tear down every stopped environment" --confirmed
```

## Output and failure contract

Every invocation writes exactly one JSON document to stdout. A success carries
`result`. A failure carries `error` with a `code` to branch on, a `message`, and a
`remedy` to act on, and exits non-zero: `2` bad invocation, `3` a model-backed
capability with no provider configured, `4` a required prerequisite is missing, `5` the
capability ran and failed. Never parse prose out of a failure, and never treat an empty
result as success.

## Sharp edges

- Environments are ephemeral, and nothing reaps them. Anything worth keeping leaves
  through `file-pull` before `destroy`, and an environment nobody destroys runs until
  the host fills up. `launch` refuses past 15 concurrent environments; set
  `AMPLIFIER_DTU_MAX_ENVIRONMENTS` to move the ceiling.
- `list` is scoped to the machine, not to a session. An environment another session
  launched appears there too, and `destroy` will take it.
- A profile is named by path. Profile names that live inside the engine's own
  repository do not resolve from an installed package.
- `manage` plans without changing anything. It runs only with `--confirmed`, which
  authorizes one invocation and nothing else. Read the plan before confirming it.
- `install` and `doctor` propose; they never install, configure, or repair anything.
- `exec` captures output and returns it. For an interactive shell inside an
  environment, use the engine's own `amplifier-digital-twin exec`.
- The model-backed capabilities send host evidence, and whatever context you pass, to
  the model provider.

## Reading more

`knowledge/profile-authoring.md` is the profile schema and the rules for a profile that
launches, for writing one by hand instead of through `create-profile`.
`knowledge/troubleshooting.md` is symptom, cause, and remedy for the host and the
runtime. The library, its configuration, and the full CLI surface are documented under
`docs/` in the repository.
